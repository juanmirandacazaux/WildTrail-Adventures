# Travel Website Demo (HTML + CSS + JavaScript + SweetAlert2)

This project is a fully responsive travel-style website inspired by modern UI/UX layouts.  
It was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**, with **DOM manipulation** and **SweetAlert2** for interactive modals (booking forms, alerts, etc.).

The layout includes a hero section, about section, services with tabs, tours preview, and a contact form.  
It uses modern styling, a clean grid system, and a simple language switcher powered with JavaScript.
